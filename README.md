# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a sleek and intuitive single-page client-side ToDo application built using modern web technologies. It was developed as a school project to showcase proficiency in JavaScript, Vue.js, and SCSS (SASS).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: TaskFlow is designed to work seamlessly across devices of all sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience whether on desktop or mobile.
  
- **Task Management**: Users can easily add, edit and delete tasks. Each task can be marked as completed helping users stay organized.
    
- **Modern UI/UX**: The user interface is designed to be clean and intuitive, with smooth transitions and feedback for user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in managing the application's state and components.

- **SCSS (SASS)**: A CSS preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic CSS syntax. SCSS was used to maintain scalable and maintainable stylesheets.

- **JavaScript**: The core programming language for building the application logic and handling dynamic content.

## Development Process

The development of TaskFlow involved several key steps:

1. **Planning and Design**: Initial wireframes and user flow diagrams were created to outline the application's structure and functionality.

2. **Implementation**: Vue.js components were developed to manage different aspects of the application, such as task creation, editing, and filtering.

3. **Styling**: SCSS was used to style the application, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.

4. **Testing and Optimization**: The application was tested across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. Performance optimizations were implemented to enhance the user experience.

5. **Deployment**: Once development and testing were complete, TaskFlow was deployed as a static website, ready for use.

## Conclusion

TaskFlow demonstrates a practical application of JavaScript, Vue.js, and SCSS in creating a functional and user-friendly ToDo application. It serves as a testament to the developer's skills in front-end web development and provides a solid foundation for future projects.
